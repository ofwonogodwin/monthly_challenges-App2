# Understanding URLS & Views in Django<br>
## Monthly Challenge App.
First of all, to begin with, this repo is not yet complete as of this commit of the READMe, <br>I just love a culture of pushing all my code to Github whether ready or not,<br>
Whether at the Beginning phase, Middle Phase, or End Phase.
#### Continuous Integration.
As time passes, I will be able to improve this code to the best of its ability.
## Who needs this
This is simple Django code that tries to illustrate the simplest way to understand URLS and Function-Based views in Django.

### This readme will also be updated as time goes on. Thanks
